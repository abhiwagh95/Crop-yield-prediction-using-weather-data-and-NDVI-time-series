# Crop-yield-prediction-using-weather-data-and-NDVI-time-series
The proposed system will be able to predict the crop yield production which will be useful to farmers for harvesting and storage. The system will use the weather forecasting which includes the parameters like temperature, rainfall, humidity, dew point and the normalized difference vegetation index time series from Sentinel-2 satellite for selected region. By using both the results obtained,accurate crop yield prediction can be calculated which will help farmers in planning efficiently, minimize costs and maximize yields—and profits—as a result.
